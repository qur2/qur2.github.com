From my reading on the web:
 - Put 50g of freshly ground coffee in a big tea bag.
 - Prepare 600ml of cold tap water.
 - Put the bag of coffee in a glass container and pour the water over.
 - Store the container in the fridge, for up to 12h.
 - Remove the coffee bag and voilà, it's ready.
 - Optionally, transfer the brew to the container you use for commuting.

Enjoy!

Pro tip: prepare in the evening, store overnight an have it ready in the morning!
