Recently, I started having an obsession about analog cameras of all kinds. For me, there are multiple reasons:

 - Some look seriously gorgeous
 - Gear can be found super cheap (but also super expensive)
 - 35mm holds plenty of details, medium format even more so
 - From fully manual to fully automatic
 - From TLRs to SLRs through rangefinders and viewfinders

I started for real last new year, when I was in Minsk. I read the "les petites annonces" and found a Moskva 5 on sale for ~40EUR. The bellow is light tight, the viewfinder is completely off and there is some stain on the very outer edge of the glass. Still, I decided to go for it and couldn't wait to come back home to start using it.

I shot my first black and white roll of uninteresting pictures just to get to know the camera. It was also the first time I dealt with a fully manual camera. When I got my pictures back from the lab, I was impressed by the massive size of the 6x9 negatives. It made me wonder why would anybody spend money on an instax camera :)
The results themselves were just as expected: a single (out of 9) pictures came out sharp enough and properly exposed. Oh, and that stain inside the lens had no impact on the pictures, that was a good news.
During the time it took to shoot the roll, I realized the camera was quite bulky and heavy. Since I wanted to carry it daily, I set to find something a bit more lightweight. After some research and probing on ebay, I decided to go for an Agfa isolette. They are plenty available and prices vary greatly.

The second try gets me a model in a good shape and with a solinar lens for ~20EUR. Unfortunately, as I learned it is often the case with those cameras, the focus ring was stuck. I managed to fix the issue with a lot of patience and I cleaned the lens while I was at it. The camera is significantly smaller and lighter than the Moskva although it makes "smaller" pictures of 6x6 centimeters.

It became my secondary camera during a trip in Sri Lanka. I shot 3 rolls (3x12 exposures) over the course of 3 weeks. Fate and a clumsy hand reduced the final number of exposures to 26: when securing the roll I had just finished, it slipped from my hand and it almost completely unrolled. Only two frames were not burned. 
When the results came from the lab, I was hugely underwhelmed: only 2 frames were sharp. All the rest is blurry by either shake, bad focus or a combination of both.

I'm now having second thought on my medium format journey: although it takes more than 4 rolls to learn to use a fully manual camera, I'm afraid I'm spreading myself thin. There is so much more I still have to learn with my digital camera that I'm wondering if getting into medium photography is a sound investment for me. I was excited by the prospect of having big negatives but I forgot to ask myself what will I do with that quantity of details. I'm not happy shooting hundreds of pictures to store them on a cold hard drive and I just added medium format scans next to my raw files.

That gets me thinking: if I work with digital files anyway, should I check the other end of the spectrum? Afterall, for me, photography is about senses. A print brings more joy than a screen.
